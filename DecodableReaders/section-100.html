<p id="p-114">Ned Slips Out of Jail Ned is serving time for his part in an attempted coach robbery. He is fed up. It's time for a plan. Next morning, Ned does not get up. He lies in bed, moaning and groaning. "I am going to die," he wails. "I need a doctor." For a week, Ned rejects all food and continues to moan. In the end, the jailer calls the doctor. As the doctor bends over Ned, Ned knocks him out. The doctor sinks to the ground. Ned dresses in the doctor's things and liftshim onto the bed. As Ned passes the jailer, he sneezes and covers his face with his handkerchief. "Is he going to die?" asks the jailer. "Soon," replies Ned. "You had better tell the minister." Ned swings himself up onto the doctor's horse and canters off. It is several hours before the doctor comes round and the jailer discovers that Ned has tricked him again. But Ned had bad luck. The doctor's horse stumbled, Ned fell off and hit his head. When he came round, the sheriff was looking down at him. "Back to jail for you, Ned." This time, Ned did not attempt to escape.</p></section>
