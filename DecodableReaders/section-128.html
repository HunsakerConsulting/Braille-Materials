</h2>
<p id="p-149">Frank and Sandra went on the train to Scotland. It was winter. It was cold. They saw snow on the ground. In the winter the days are short. In the north of Scotland it gets darkat 3 o'clock in the afternoon. In the morning, the sun rises after 9 o'clock and the ground is coated with frost. The train had lots of stops. It crossed rivers and went in tunnels. In Scotland they saw lots of old houses and shops. The houses were black. They looked drab and dark. Lots of houses did not have a garden. They had no spot for the kids to run and play. The kids had to go to the park or stay in the house. In Scotland, they have buses with a top deck and a bottom deck. It is fun to sit on top. You can see a lot from the top of the bus. The traditional dress of men and boys in Scotland is the kilt. Their legs must get cold in winter. Frank bought a kilt to help him remember his trip to Scotland. Sandra bought a tartan blanket to help her remember the trip to Scotland.</p></section>
