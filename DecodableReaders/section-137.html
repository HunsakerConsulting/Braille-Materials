</h2>
<p id="p-178">Today is the day Tim and Jack have been waiting for. The raft is stocked with food, sleeping bags and a tent and the boys are ready for adventure. Mum and Dad help launch the home-made raft and, this time, they have long paddles to steer it with and propel it along. The boys fish as the raft is carried gently down the river by the current. They avoid the shallow water where they went aground last time and, as the sun begins to set, they head for the sheltered cove they spotted on their last trip. Carefully, they drag the raft onto the beach and set up camp. They make a fire, cook dinner and then snuggle into their sleeping bags with the dogs at their feet. What the boys do not know is that there are robbers nearby who have been watching them. In the night, the robbers steal the raft and set off down the river. But the dogs hear them. They begin to bark and demand to be let out of the tent. The boys follow the dogs and, in the light of the full moon, they see the raft disappear as it rounds a bend in the river. Tim and Jack, with the dogs at their heels, take a shortcut. The dogs run into the water, barking, and swim to the raft. As the dogs grab a rope each and begin to drag the raft back to shore, the robbers lose their balance and topple into the water. The robbers were outwitted this time, but the boys have not seen the last of them.</p></section>
