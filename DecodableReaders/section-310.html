<p id="p-358">Dad, can we get a film?" said Fran and Frank. "Yes," said Dad, "What film will you get?" "One with a big, red dog," said Fran. "No sis, one with a soft, wet frog," said Frank. "Not a problem for me," said Dad. "One with a pet pig who lost his pen," said Frank. "No Frank, one with a hip hippo and his hotrod," said Fran. "Not a problem for me," said Dad. "A fat rat, a full bull, and a hungry hog," said Fran with a wink. "Or a tall rat swimming in a pond on the sun," said Frank with a grin. "Not a problem for me," said Dad. "What" You will get a film with all that?" said Fran and Frank. "No," said Dad, "I said it is not a problem for me." "Who is it a problem for then?" said Frank and Fran. "Mom," Dad grinned.</p></section>
