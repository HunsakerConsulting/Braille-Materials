</h2>
<p id="p-131">I have lived with dogs and cats and I strongly believe that dogs are much better pets than cats. For a start, dogs are friendly animals. They are always happy to see you and they are good company. Dogs like people. Cats don"t. You can have fun with a dog in the house, in the backyard or in the park. Dogs will run with you, fetch a ball or stick, and can catch a Frisbee. As well as being good fun, this helps you and the dog keep fit. Cats are not much fun at all. The fact that dogs are reliable is important. They look after your home. Even when they seem to be asleep, they are listening for unusual sounds and bark if they think there is danger. Cats just leave your yard and roam the sterets. This is not much help at all. Did you know that domestic cats are killers" They often catch small animals, such as rats and chickens and bring them into the house. How would you feel if you went in your bedroom and found a mangled rodent on the bed" Dogs never do such horrible things. The best thing about dogs is that they are loyal. They wag their tails when they see you, and still love you, even if you step on them by mistake, or give them a bath when they do not want one. You must agree that dogs make better pets than cats. Dogs are fun. They helpyou keep fit. They stop you feeling lonely, protect your house and don"t wander off or kill small animals. The best thing about dogs is that they will love you and be your faithful friend to the end.</p></section>
