<p id="p-278">Mr. Butler's class is having food day. Every student in the class is bringing in a favorite food to share with the class. Natasha has spaghetti and meatballs. Janet is sharing chicken and rice, and Mike has tuna casserole. All the kids in the class are ready to eat except for Todd.  "Where is Todd?"  asks Mr. Butler.  "He is late!"  The kids all look at each other and shrug their shoulders. Todd wasn?t on the bus this morning. Suddenly, Todd comes bursting through the door with a big pot in his hands. "I am so sorry I am late today,"  he says.  "A raccoon got into my house last night and ate all the chili. My dad and I had to make more before I came to school."  "I have never had chili before,"  says Natasha.  "Oh, you must try it!"  says Todd.  "It is so good!"  "Well then, let's start eating!"  says Mr. Butler. All the kids set out their food, and Mr. Butler passes out plates and forks. All the kids start to eat. Todd chews his chili, but then he makes a face. "What is wrong, Todd?"  asks Mr. Butler. "My chili is chilly!"  cries Todd.  "It is supposed to be hot!"   "Don?t worry, Todd,"  says Mike.  "It tastes great! I think Iwould always choose to eat it this way!"  "Oh, yes!"  says Janet.  "If you were a seller selling chili from your cellar, I would want it chilly."  Everyone in the class agrees that they love the chilly chili. When Todd gets home, he says hi to his mom and then tells her all about the high praise he got for his chili.</p></section>
