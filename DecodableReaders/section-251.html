<p id="p-299">Stertch lives on Spring Steret. He has dogs, cats, pigs, and chicks. Each dayStertch puts a leash on his dogs, cats, and pigs. He takes them for a walk on Spring Steret. Stertch can not put his chicks on a leash. They get mad and scratch him! The chicks stay at home and strut around. By ten, the dogs, cats, and pigs are home. So is Stertch. He then sprays the pens to clean them. "Is it time for lunch yet?" asks Stertch impatiently. He feeds his animals scraps. Then he goes to his home to eat. The Scared Cat Will has to paint the back steps. He scrapes the sides and then paints white stripes. As he paints, a stray cat snoops around the steps. Will sees that the cat is not walking well. "Oh my!" yells Will. "Did you sprain your leg" Can I pick you up?" The cat is nearly out of Will's reach. The cat is scared. "Do not scratch" begs Will. "I will save you!" Will strains to keep the cat in his arms. He takes the cat to the steps and feeds it milk. The cat laps it up and demands more. "Not yet, cat" says Will. "You need to rest!" Then Will and the cat take a nap.</p></section>
