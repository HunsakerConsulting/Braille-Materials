<p id="p-140">Tom has a truck. When he goes on the road, his dog, Baxter, goes with him. Tom and Baxter set off for Bimbi Park with a load of fodder. The road runs along the top of steep cliffs. All of a sudden, a kangaroo hops onto the road. Tom swerves to avoid the kangaroo but the truck careers over the cliff and into the sea. Baxter gets out of the truck but Tom is stuck. Baxter swims to land to get help. He runs into Liz and Bud. Baxter was barking non-stop and looking out to sea. Liz rings "" " and Bud swims to the sinking truck. He helps Tom get out of the truck and gets him to the beach. When the rescue team gets there, Tom is sitting with Bud, Liz and Baxter on the sand. He is in pain but OK apart from his bleeding leg. Tom goes to hospital and Baxter goes with him. Good dog, Baxter!</p></section>
