</h2>
<p id="p-306">The town of Thousand Owls is dry. It has not rained in Thousand Owls for five years! There is not a flower anywhere in the town. But there are lots of owls! They sit outside the town hall. One owl named Scowl always has a frown on his face. That is how he got his name. Scowl does not like Thousand Owls. "It is too dry!" he loudly complained one day. "I want to get out of here." Scowl flew beyond Thousand Owls. It was wet and rainy. "I don?t like it here either!" said Scowl. "It's too wet!" Scowl flew to tell his mom. "Mom" he said, "let's get out of town. Let's go where it is wet part of the time and dry part of the time. We will have the best of both worlds!" Howling Sounds Lisa lives in New York. Her dad just took her to Arizona. It is warm there all year round. When she came home, she told her classmates about her trip. "It was very hot and dry there" said Lisa. "Some animals howl at night. They make loud sounds." "Did you see snakes?" asked Ted. "Oh, yes!" exclaimed Lisa. "I saw lots of snakes. They are such outstanding creatures!" Lisa's class asked to hear more. Just then, the bell sounded outside the school. "Not now" begged Lisa. "We?ll be late for class! But after classI will tell you what I found on my trip!" Lisa and her classmates ran to school. They made it just in time!</p></section>
