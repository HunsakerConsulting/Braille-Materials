Kit, Kaz and Lee went for lunch at a pasta bar. Kit sat in the back of the car. Kaz offers Kit some pasta on a spoon. Do you think she will eat it" Kit tries the pasta. It's good. She gets stuck into it. Kit licks the last bit off the ground. How do Kaz and Lee stop Kit from running off from the pasta bar" Kit likes to play with a ball in a sock. Kaz teases her by swinging the ball in the air. Kit jumps up and grabs the ball. Do you think Kaz lets go" Kit and Lee play tug. Kit's teeth are strong. Sometimes she wins. Sometimes Lee wins and teases Kit. What do you think of that" Kit had a good time with Kaz and Lee. Do you think they spoilt her" Why do you think they spoilt her"</p></section>
