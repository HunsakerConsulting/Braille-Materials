<p id="p-115">Ned and the Train Theft Ned spent six months in jail as punishment for holding up a coach. Free again, Ned told his band of bandits, Pip, Sam and Tom, his latest plan. Just before he was set free, Ned overheard the jailers discussing a shipment of gold soon to be sent by rail from Cooper's Creek to Wilmington. The train would pass through Bond. It was dusk, and the express train was speeding across the plains to Bond, when the driver spotted a cart on the track. He sounded the horn but the cart did not move. Was it stuck" He applied the brakes and the train screeched to a standstill, just short of the cart. The express-men, who had the job of protecting the gold shipment, did not stop to lock the rail-car as they ran to helpthe driver get the cart off the track. They had to be quick. The train was due in Bond at ten o"clock. Ned, Sam and Pip were waiting behind a massive rock. They crept out and slid on their tummies until they got to the unlocked rail-car. Each took a sack and ran to where Tom was holding the horses. Ned and his gang of bandits galloped off into the hills. When the driver and guards got back to the train, they chuckled. Back at camp, Ned and his gang could not wait to open the sacks. But when they did, it was not gold that they found but coal. Then they heard the clip-clop of horses" hooves. From the train, the sheriff had seen the gang gallop into the hills. At Bond, he rounded up a bunch of local men to help him track the robbers. They found Ned and his gang still looking at the coal, scattered on the ground. If Ned and the bandits had waited, they would have seen a second train speed past, less than an hour later. They had been tricked. The sheriff put handcuffs on Ned and led him back to jail.</p></section>
