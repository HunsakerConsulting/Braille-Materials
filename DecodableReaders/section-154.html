</h2>
<p id="p-195">We went all the way to the Arctic to see polar bears in the wild. We travelled on a little ship. Each day, we went hunting. Each day, we saw lots of interesting animals and birds, but no polar bears. When we got off the ship, we went hunting in rubber zodiacs or we paddled canoes. We did not hunt with guns. We hunted with cameras and binoculars. We looked high up on the cliffs. Alas! We saw no polar bears. Off we go again in our quest to find a polar bear. At last, high up on the cliffs, we see a dot. Is it a polar bear" Yes! Will he come down to the water" We must sit in our little boats and wait. Slowly the polar bear gets closer. He is dirty brown, not clean white. Then splash! He jumps into the water and swims across the bay. We follow him, very slowly. We must not make a sound. The polar bear is an expert hunter. It mostly eats seals. It is said that a polar bear can smell a seal up to 20 miles  away! When there are plenty of seals, adult polar bears just eat the fat as it provides a lot more energy. They leave the carcass for the scavengers, such as foxes and ravens. They also eat white whales and walruses as well as kelp , fish sea birds, and mussels. The polar bear is heading for land. He swims past the ducks. I think he is looking for something bigger today. The polar bear gets out of the water and shakes himself like a dog. We sit in the zodiac and watch him. It is fantastic to be so close. Polar bears spend about half their day hunting and for the rest of the time, they sleep and rest. We see the polar bear lie on the snow and have a nap. After a short time, he wakes up and rolls in the snow. He looks just like a big, cuddly puppy. The next day, we saw more polar bears. We saw them kill a seal and eat it. They did not look cuddly at all.</p></section>
