<p id="p-118">Let's look at Jarra's shopping list:</p>
<p id="p-119">1 pack of butter</p>
<p id="p-120">1 carton of milk</p>
<p id="p-121">1 kilogram of plums</p>
<p id="p-122">1 packet of mints</p>
<p id="p-123">1 bunch of cress</p>
<p id="p-124">2 cans of dog food</p>
<p id="p-125">Jarra goes into the supermarket. There is not much on the shopping list so he picks up a basket from the stack. Jarra gets the pack of butter and a carton of milk off the shelf. Mum said ten plums is about 1 kilogram. He counts the plums. The packet of mints is on the shelf with the sweets. Jarra is tempted by the Smarties but mum said no extras. He just gets the mints. Jarra selects a bunch of cress. There is just the dog food left on the list. Jarra spots the cans of dog food and picks 2 cans: beef and chicken chunks. Jarra goes to the checkout and waits. He puts the shopping on the bench and checks his list. Butter, milk, plums, mints, cress, 2 cans of dog food. "That will be fifteen dollars and twenty cents," said the shopkeeper. "Will you need a bag?" "No thanks," replied Jarra, remembering the bags he had left on the hook on the kitchen door. "I"ll be OK" . Jarra paid the shopkeeper fifteen dollars and twenty cents and was given the docket. What do you think Jarra did with the shopping without a bag" What would you do" He tried the bag of plums in his hood but it did not fit. He tucked the carton of milk under his arm and put the pack of butter in the pocket of his jumper. He collected the rest of the goods and held them in his hands: plums, 2 cans of dog food, cress, bag of mints.</p></section>
