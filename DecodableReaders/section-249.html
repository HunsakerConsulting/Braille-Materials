</h2>
<p id="p-297">Rules are made to keep us safe. Staying out of the steret is a good rule. Using a floating tube in the water is safe, too. Do not assume that a rule is made to make you mad. When you are in someone else's home, try to follow the rules. You do not want to be rude! It is a good idea to follow rules in class, too. Your teacher wants you to keep safe. What rules must you follow" Bad Jude Jude fell and cut his hand. His mom had told him to be careful. She even repeated the swimming rule: "Do not run on the deck." Jude did not listen. He ran. The deck was wet and he cut his hand. Dr. June told Jude, "I am going to put a bit of cream from this tube on your hand." Jude was upset. "Will I be able to swim?" he asked. "YesJude. But not until you use up all the cream in this tube" said Dr. June. Jude was not happy. But he will follow the rules from now on!</p></section>
