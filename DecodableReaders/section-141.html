</h2>
<p id="p-182">Have you ever wished you could visit Antarctica" I did, and I was lucky. My wish came true. I went by ship from South America. It took two days. The sea was quite calm with no big waves. Sometimes it is choppy and people get sea sick. The ship I went on was MV Explorer. Most people just called it "The Little Red Ship"."The Little Red Ship" could only carry 108 passengers. This meant that we could all get off the ship quickly, each time it got to land. We saw masses of ice and snow and there were many animals and birds to look at. Every day we landed at a new place. We went ashore in little rubber boats, called zodiacs. They were great fun. Each time we went ashore, we took lots of food, tents and safety equipment in case the ship sank while we were on land. Antarctica is a scary place and you would not live long, without food and shelter, if the ship sank. The icebergs were huge and had very odd shapes. Most of them were much, much bigger than "The Little Red Ship." We felt very small whenever we got near them. A ship must not go too close. An iceberg can roll over on top of you and sink your ship or zodiac. One day we went way down south to the Weddell Sea. The sea was all ice."The Little Red Ship" had to cut a track through the ice. We all stood at the bow of the ship as it cracked the ice. What would we do if the ice froze again and locked us in" At last, the captain stopped the ship. Members of the crew tested the ice to make sure it was thick and then we all got off. We did not need a little rubber boat, that day. We just climbed down the ladder. A penguin came across to see us. We were told to lie down on the ice so we did not scare it. Don"t we look stupid lying on the ice! The penguin was not scared of us so we stood up and took photos. Wow! What a trip! I will never forget it.</p></section>
