</h2>
<p id="p-204">The Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union had been raging since the end of World War II, and while these two superpowers never officially declared war on each other, they fought indirectly in the wars of other countries, the arms race, and the space race. In 1961, Russia had the upper hand. They had launched the first satellite, known as Sputnilk and the first man, Yuri Gagarin, into space. Worried that the United States was falling behind the Soviet Union in technology and prestige, Presisdent Kennedy, in a speech to Congress in 1961, challenged the nation to put a man on the moon before the end of the decade, and bring him home safely. Kennedy did not live to see the fulfilment of his challenge. He was assassinated in 1963 and Richard Nixon was President when the three astronauts, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins completed their historic space mission. Apollo II was the space flight that landed the first humans on the moon. The spacecraft had three parts: The Command Module , nicknamed the Eagle. On July 16, Apollo II was launched by a Saturn V rocket, the biggest rocket ever made, from the Kennedy Space Center. Once the last stage of the rocket had propelled the spacecraft towards the moon, it was three days before the astronauts entered into a lunar orbit. At this point, Armstrong and Aldrin moved into the spider-like Lunar Module and were blasted from the Command Module to the moon. Collins orbited the moon alone in the Command Module until it was time to meet up with them for the trip home, 21 hours later. As Armstong stepped onto the moon, watched by televison viewers the world over, he spoke the words for which he will always be remembered: "That's one small step for a man2 one giant leap for mankind." These words heralded a new reality: that one day, humans might live on the moon. Then he and Aldrin planted the American flag and saluted it. Armstrong and Aldrin spent about three hours on the moon. They collected rocks to take home and left mementoes, including  goodwill messages from 73 world leaders. It was July 20th, 1969 On July 24, 1969, eight days, three hours and eighteen minutes after lift-off, the Commmand Module, Columbia, splashed down in the Pacific. Mission accomplished. Aldrin, Armstrong, and Collins returned to a hero's welcome. The Command Module, Columbia, is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.</p></section>
