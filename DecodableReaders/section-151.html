</h2>
<p id="p-192">Ben King is a private detective. His most recent assignment was to locate a valuable statue that had been stolen from an American collector. King's search took him to a remote cliff top cottage. He looked inside and saw three men standing around a large wooden crate. One of the men handed wads of dollars to the other two and then made a call on his mobile phone. The men sat down. They seemed to be waiting for something. King waited, too. He knew he could not take on three men on his own, but when one man left the room, he made his move. He entered the house and accosted the two men. Immediately, the third man returned. He aimed his gun at Ben and fired. King was winged. He staggered out of the house and fell to the ground. Then they heard a helicopter approach. The man with the gun staggered towards the helicopter with the crate. It looked as if he would get away. But King had a different plan. Despite the pain in his arm, he jumped into his car and drove towards the helicopter. Surely, King didn"t plan to crash the car into the helicopter. The man panicked. He dropped the crate and made a dash for the chopper. As King heard the engine start up, he rolled out of the car onto the ground and watched as it careered into the helicopter and burst into flames. King phoned for help. He picked up the gun, dropped by the thief when he let go of the crate, and strode towards the house. The two men gave themselves up and King held them at gun point until the police arrived.</p></section>
