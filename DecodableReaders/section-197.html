<p id="p-245">Lily thought that the kids in school were not friendly. This was the third time she had changed schools. The other students had been friends for years. Lily was not happy and felt awkward. She ate her lunch alone. She was eating when a girl came up to her.  "Hi, I am Nell,"  said the girl. Lily felt shy. "Hi, I?m Lily,"  she whispered. "Welcome to school!"  said Nell.  "It's your first day, right?"  she asked. Lily nodded her head.  "Come with me and meet my friends,"  grinned Nell. Lily got up and followed Nell to a table with lots of kids.  "This is Lily!"  proclaimed Nell. All the kids waved hello. Lily had made a mistake. The kids were nice! Lily sat down at the table with Nell and her friends and met everyone.</p></section>
