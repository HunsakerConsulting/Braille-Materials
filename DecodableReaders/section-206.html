<p id="p-254">Mitch's alarm clock went off at 7 a.m. It was time to wake up and get ready for school. Just as he was getting out of bed, his dad came in.  "You get to stay home today, Mitch. School is closed. It's a snow day!"  Mitch jumped up and ran to the window. He stared outside, but he could barely see anything?it was a blizzard! Snowflakes were blowing sideways. When the storm ended, everything was white. Mitch was so excited, he wanted to go out and play in the snow. Mitch's dad made him eat a late breakfast, and then he bundled up to go outside. Mitch built a snowman and tossed snowballs. Soon he was very cold and had to go back inside. His dad made him hot chocolate, and Mitch got warm fast. He was so happy to get a snow day!</p></section>
