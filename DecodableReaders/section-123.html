</h2>
<p id="p-144">Our grey kitten, Smokey, likes to be in everything. Smokey is a boy. He will make a toy out of anything. He has just been in the Cornflakes box. Now he is trying to get in the bag. He loves to hide in his tunnel. When a person gets too close he jumps out at them. He loves to run quickly in one end of the tunnel and out again. He is a tease. He runs out, hits you and runs back in. This looks like fun. It goes round and round. Next it goes whoosh. I wish I could get in here. Ha!  She left the lid open. I can get in and play in here. What am I in today" I can hide under the pillow. You have to look very hard to find me under here. I might stay here. This box is just the right size for Smokey. He can easily lift the lid and hide in here. Oh! No!  It is a tight fit. Smokey is getting bigger. What am I in here" Well I am inquisitive. I like to check everything but I can tell from her grumpy look that I am in strife. I get in strife when I do things I am told not to do. I had better get out of here. Now he is in the basket. What should be in this basket" Not Smokey!  It is a rubbish basket but he tipped all the rubbish out and got in there himself. This is a pretty tight fit too. Where am I" I am in dreamland. I am very tired and I am fast asleep. Please do not wake me up. This is not an odd way to sleep. It is typical for a Rag Doll cat which is what I am.</p></section>
