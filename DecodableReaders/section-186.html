<p id="p-234">Otis hoped to see crabs and toads in their own habitat. He asked Dad to go on a trip to Lake Hope and Stone Bay. Otis and Dad drove on a slow, winding road to Lake Hope. They rented a row boat to go over the lake and into the bay. They rowed to the bay and floated in the still water. Otis spotted a toad by the side of the boat. Dad put his finger to his lips. "Keep your voice low, Otis. This is the toad's home,"  Dad whispered. Otis nodded. They sat and watched the toad. It began to croak. The wind started to blow, and the boat rose and dove in the waves. As Otis and Dad rowed back, Otis spotted a big crab by the coast. It made his day!</p></section>
