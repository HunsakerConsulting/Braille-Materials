<p id="p-265">Ann liked reading. Each week, she went to the public library to choose three books to bring home. Monday was library day. Her mom dropped her off before she went shopping. "I?ll be back in an hour,"  Mom said. Ann went into the library and walked up and down the rows of books. She loved to see all the books lined up on the shelves. She browsed through a book about a person who is a master chess player but decided not to check it out. She looked at the index of a book about cactuses growing in the Grand Canyon. She flipped through a cookbook. She liked the chapter on roasting perfect garden vegetables. All the books contained interesting facts. She was having a big problem selecting books for the week! After much debate, she decided on three books. She was just in time. Ann looked at her watch ? her hour was up! Mom was already waiting outside</p></section>
