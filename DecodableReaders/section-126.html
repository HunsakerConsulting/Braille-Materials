<p id="p-147">May I tell you a story, please-About a pirate who travelled the seven seas, About a ship, that battled a mighty breeze, And the pirate's cat, that was Siamese. This is what happened, I"ll set the scene: He was the scariest pirate there's ever been. His hair was smelly and his teeth were green-And he went by the name of Dirty Dean. The ship would sail by day and night, And Dean would never have to fight. He was such a revolting sight, That all the other pirates ran away in fright! The Scurvy Dogs were his hand-picked crew, And those dogs all knew what to do. They ate fish stew and learned kung fu From the captain's cat, whose name was Boo. Through latitude and longitude They acted crude, they acted rude. Their odour had an attitude: It wasn"t very pleasant, dude. But something changed for Dirty Dean, Who"d always had the worst hygiene. He"d never washed, was never clean, A toothbrush he had never seen. It was a dark and stormy night. A hurricane of awesome might Turned the ship into a kite, And Dirty Dean went for a flight. The Scurvy Dogs abandoned ship. And Boo and Dean went on a trip. They felt the boat beneath them tip And then it did a double flip. The storm it blew, the ship it flew, And Dean and Boo, the next they knew, Were washed ashore without a clue Of what they were supposed to do. But on the white and sandy beach An island girl, whose name was Peach, Stepped up to them and made a speech, And handed them an apple each. And even though he wasn"t sure,  Peel and core he ate it raw. It tasted good. He wanted more. Could it be true, could this be real" She then produced a fruity meal. He ate it all with fevered zeal. He even ate the orange peel! Peach knew that Dean, enjoyed the fruit, And even in his pirate suit, She thought that he was not a brute. In fact she found him kind of cute. But when she saw his teeth were green, And then she caught a whiff of Dean  She knew she had to get him clean!</p></section>
