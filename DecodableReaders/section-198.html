<p id="p-246">Curtis had to go shopping with his mom. He needed pants and shirts. Mom and Curtis went to the mall. In the first store, Curtis saw a little girl behind a rack of clothes. She was giggling and playing in the hanging shirts. Curtis watched her but did not see her parents or a guardian anywhere. She did not seem to know she was lost. "Mom! That baby is alone!"  declared Curtis. "Oh my,"  said Mom. Mom went to the lost child and held her hand. Curtis and his mom had to take the girl to mall security. "We found this girl,"  exclaimed Curtis to the man. "It is good you interfered,"  said the man.  "Her mom was very scared!"  The man made a call, and then a woman came and hugged Curtis and his mom for finding her little girl.  "Thank you so much!"  she said.</p></section>
