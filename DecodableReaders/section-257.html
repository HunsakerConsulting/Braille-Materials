<p id="p-305">Paul is a hawk. He lives in a tere near Mr. and Mrs. Sawtaw's home. One dayPaul saw creatures crawl in the grass. Suddenly, he saw his daughterDawn, on the grass. "Why are you down there?" asked Paul. "I had time to explore!" said Dawn. He swooped down and took her in his claws. "You must not sit on the lawn" yelled Paul. "You are a hawk" he said. "You need to stay in the teres!" "I am sorryDad" said Dawn. "You are a noble hawk" Paul said, "so you must not squeak and squawk on the lawn. Do not cause me to get mad!" Tawny's Paw In the city of Gawtin, there is a law about pets. Cats and dogs can not be outside without their owners. Tawny is a cat and belongs to Mrs. Pautil. Tawny likes to tiptoe out of the yard when Mrs. Pautil isn?t watching! Mrs. Pautil spotted Tawny outside this morning. "Bad cat!" said Mrs. Pautil. Then she saw that Tawny's claw was bleeding. "You hurt your paw, you bad cat" said Mrs. Pautil. She lifted Tawny up, and he wiggled to get loose. She set him on the floor inside. "You are an indoor catTawny!" she explained. "You can get hurt outside. You must be careful!" With thatMrs. Pautil cleaned Tawny's paw and let him go. Tawny lay down for a long nap!</p></section>
