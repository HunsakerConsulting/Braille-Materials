<p id="p-201">Green Ants and a Scorpion Gerty is a green tere ant. She lives in a colony of half a million ants. Scarp is a tere scorpion. Like spiders, scorpions have 8 legs and are easily recognised by their pincers and a segmented tail that ends with a very nasty stinger, full of venom. In some scorpions there is enough venom to kill a human being. One day Gerty, a worker ant, was foraging for food on her own, when she met Scarp. Although the scorpion was much bigger than her, Gerty knew no fear. She attacked Scarp, biting him fiercely with her serrated mandibles, then squirting formic acid from the tip of her tail into the wound. Scarp was enraged as the pain shot through his system. When he realized that this puny ant had inflicted the wound, he turned around and stabbed her with his stinger, killing Gerty almost instantly, but not before she had sent a strong chemical signal to her sisters at the nest. The other ants, realizing that Gerty had sacrificed her life for them, set out to attack the scorpion and bring it back for food. They followed the chemical trail left by Gerty and soon found Scarp. They bit the scorpion until he had no resistance left. Then they sucked up all his life juices as he lay dying and scattered his limbs all around. They took the best bits back to feed others in the nest.</p></section>
