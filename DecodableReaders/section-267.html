Tell the town this dire news!" yelled Yire. The town crier ran to the hill and screamed. "A fire is in our town! Leave now!" Many left right away. Others had to be lured out. They had wanted to stay. Soon, the town was empty. The kingYire, and the town crier stood on the hill. The fire was put out quickly. Before long, the town was as good as new. The crier had saved the day!
