<p id="p-311">Marge is making fudge for a party. Marge needs a large amount since the party will be huge. Marge went to fetch chocolate this morning. She came home to make the fudge. When she went to her pantry, she saw something strange. There had been a smudge of chocolate inside in the morning. Now, the chocolate was missing! ShockedMarge leaned on a ledge. "I put it in there just a while ago" she explained. "It should not have budged! Without the chocolate, there can be no fudge!" Marge felt behind a ridge in the pantry. "Oh, no!" she yelled. Her dogSmidge, sneaked out of the pantry. His face was full of chocolate. Smidge licked Marge's face. "I forgive you. But what about my fudge?" she moaned. Midge's Picnic "Let's have a picnic in the park by the bridge" said Midge. "We can get a whole range of food!" Midge's mom liked his idea. "I will go to the market to get food" said his mom. "I can put it in the fridge at home until the party." Midge stayed by the bridge to plan the picnic. He cleaned the picnic ledges and set out games. He arranged placemats on the ledges for a change of color. Then he called his friends. His mom brought food and put it on the picnic ledges. "The rest is in the fridge at home. I will get it." When his mom returnedMidge had finished setting up for the picnic. His friends came. "It is ActivityActivityDraw and write about a party you want to have. McGrtime to judge who can make their tummy bulge the most!" declared Midge, and they devoured the food.</p></section>
