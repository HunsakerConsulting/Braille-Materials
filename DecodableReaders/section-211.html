</h2>
<p id="p-259">It was a hot day in July. It was ninety-five degrees! Jane was in the mood to go swimming, but she did not have a pool. Jane tried to think of how to cool off. As she sat there thinking, the phone rang. It was Penny. Penny had a pool and wanted to know if Jane could come and swim in her pool. Jane grabbed her swimsuit and zoomed on her bike to Penny's. Penny was swimming in the pool when Jane got there. Jane got ready to jump in, but Penny asked her to grab a ball first so they could play with it. It was a big ball that looked like a globe! Jane threw the ball to Penny and then jumped in the pool. Jane and Penny played with the ball and spent the rest of the day splashing around.</p></section>
