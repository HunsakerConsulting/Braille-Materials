<p id="p-240">Jin wanted to plant a shrub in the backyard, but she did not know how. She went to ask her sister, but she did not tell.  "Read this book. It will help,"  her sister said. Jin spent the night reading. The next day, Jin went in the back. She dug a hole in the mud and planted seeds. She sprinkled water on the seeds and left. Then she had to wait. After a few days, Jin went in the yard and there was a sprout! It was tiny and green. Jin let the sprout have water and sun for three weeks. It was hard to wait, but Jin knew she had to. Later that spring, Jin went to check on the sprout. It had grown so big! Jin was overjoyed!</p></section>
