</h2>
<p id="p-273">This is a fable about a girl named Mabel. One day, she was out in the forest and saw a wild horse eating grass. She slowly approached the horse so it wouldn?t be afraid. The horse's ears perked up as Mabel got closer. "I won?t hurt you,"  whispered Mabel. The horse didn?t move, so Mabel crawled closer and kept talking to the horse. Soon she was level with his eyes. The horse snorted and Mabel giggled.  "I am going to call you Snort!"  she said. Mabel was able to coax Snort to follow her home. She gave Snort a flannel blanket so he wouldn?t get cold. She gave him hay and lots of water. Soon, all the people in town had heard the tale about how Mabel tamed the wild horse.</p></section>
