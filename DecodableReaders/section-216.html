</h2>
<p id="p-264">Paul and his family lived in the city, but they were moving to the suburbs. The city was full of tall buildings. In the suburbs, there were a lot of lawns with green grass. Their new house was near the beach! Paul would be able to take walks near the water and swim in the sea with his mom and dad. Paul could not wait to feel the salt water on his skin. He hoped one day he could be taught how to surf. Maybe someday he could surf near a coral reef. In his new room, Paul could hear the crashing of the waves. Paul thought this would keep him awake at night, but the sound of the waves was soothing and helped Paul to fall asleep. Paul loved living in the suburbs!</p></section>
