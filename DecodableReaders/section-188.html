<p id="p-236">Chuck, Bill, and Liz are on a baseball team. The team is behind by a run. It is Bill's turn to bat. The coach talks to Bill. He steps up to the plate.  "Get a hit, Bill!"  his team cheers from the bench. Here is the pitch. It just misses his nose and he flinches. The next pitch Bill swings and hits the ball! Bill's team watches as the girl in left field catches the high fly. Liz steps up to the plate and checks her swing. The pitch comes. She takes a chance and swings. Liz hits the ball! She runs to first base and stops. Chuck is going to pinch hit. Chuck swings at the pitch, and CRACK, he makes a big hit! It is going, going?gone! Chuck hits a home run! All the kids cheer for Chuck. He has helped his team win the game.</p></section>
