</h2>
<p id="p-177">Tim and Jack, and the two dogs, set off on their homemade raft. As they have no way to steer or propel the craft, they let it drift with the current. They are having their lunch, when they feel a bump and are thrust forward as the raft abruptly comes to a stop. They have drifted into shallow water and gone aground. The raft is stuck on a sand bar. The boys jump off the raft, quickly followed by the dogs. With less weight, the raft rises enough to allow the boys to gently push it off the sand bar and into deeper water. Tim and Jack decide that it is time to go home. They harness the dogs to the front of the raft. As the dogs drag the raft from the front, the boys, waist deep in water, push the raft from behind. Their plans may have been thwarted today but as they wade through the water, the boys plan their next trip. What do you think the boys are planning to do on their next trip" Next time, the boys will have paddles to propel and steer the raft, a tent and sleeping bags.</p></section>
