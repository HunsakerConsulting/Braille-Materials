</h2>
<p id="p-300">Marty is an ape. He needs to eat each day. Marty can go far from his home to seek food. He eats fruit, leaves, seeds, or a core. He also nibbles on corn. For Marty, it is a bore to just sit. He likes to sort sticks and run. He likes to swing from his arm. Marty likes to lie under the stars. He likes to play and see the night sky. Marty likes to have fun! Marty must stay far from cars. He needs to live in the forest where it is warm and safe. Marty is a kind ape! Bart Gets a Pet Bart wants to have a pet. He will go and find a pet. But he needs to learn more about what kind of pet he can get. After he reads about petsBart gets an idea. "I want a python!" he screams. "It can slide on my carpet." He will go and get this pet. Bart darts out and sees Ned. Ned asks, "Bart, what pet will you get?" "I will get a snake!" Bart tells Ned. "Bart!" Ned cries. "Pythons hiss and hiss!" Bart starts to think. "I think I will get a hamster instead!"</p></section>
