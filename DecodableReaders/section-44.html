</h2>
<p id="p-58">The fast train from Benton to Leeds is speeding along the rail tracks and the passengers have settled in for the non-stop trip. On a platform along the track a drama is unfolding. A mum is getting a ticket and her baby is asleep in his pram. She does not see the pram begin to roll to the edge of the platform and topple onto the rails. An old man seeing it happen jumps onto the tracks, grabs the infant from the pram and hands him to his mum. Passengers standing on the platform gasp in horror. The old man attempts to drag himself up onto the platform but it is too difficult. He runs along the tracks hoping that the train will stop before it gets to him. He stumbles and sprains his ankle but keeps going as fast as he can, terrified that the train will run into him. The train driver also sees what is happening and applies the brakes. Passengers standing in the corridors fall against one another and passengers who are sitting are jolted onto the floor. The train stops just a meter from the man. The disterssed mum hugs and kisses him when he is helped onto the platform and the passengers on the platform clap. It is a miracle that the train did not kill the old man.</p></section>
