<p id="p-85">Zang set off on a week-long terk. He took a big rucksack. In the rucksack was a sleeping bag, lots of food, a flask and a pot to cook in. Zang did not pack a tent and there was no need for water as the creeks were full. Plod, plod, plod he went, up the hills and along the hilltops. Zang went to bed at sunset. He slept in the open, snug in his sleeping bag. At six o"clock on the second morning, it began to rain. Soon Zang's sleeping bag was soaking wet, his rucksack was soaking wet and Zang was soaking wet. Do you think Zang went on or did he ring his mum and ask her to collect him" Zang was seventeen.</p></section>
