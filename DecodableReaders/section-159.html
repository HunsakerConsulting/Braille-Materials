</h2>
<p id="p-200">Atlantic puffins are a comical bird. They look funny with their bright orange beaks and big orange feet and are extermely entertaining to watch. In countries, like Iceland where puffins nest, they have been given nicknames like "clowns of the sea" and "sea parrots" and are often the subject of cartoons. Atlantic puffins are only found in the North Atlantic Ocean, where the weather is very cold. They spend most of their lives at sea and nest in colonies on coastal cliffs, in the breeding season. Puffins are well adapted to their environment. Perched high on steep cliffs near their nesting grounds, they can spot fish from a long way off and dive as far as 60 meters deep to catch them. They swim by flapping their wings underwater and using their feet to steer. In the breeding season, puffins" beaks get bigger and their feet and beaks turn bright orange. They dig burrows about 90 centimeters long in rocky cliffs, either in the soil or between rocks, and lay just one egg, each year. After the chick, known as a puffling, has hatched, the parent birds take turns bringing it fish to eat several times a day. At six weeks old, a chick can live alone. It heads off to the ocean without its parents and stays at sea until it is two to three years old. Puffins need to eat about forty small fish a day. They can catch several fish in one dive and their big, parrot-like beak is specially formed to hold a row of fish while it catches more. They can carry around ten fish at a time. The parent birds spend autumn and winter on the open ocean far from land and return each spring to their cliff-top breeding colony. They often become mates for life and use the same burrow year after year. Smoked puffin breast is a delicacy in Iceland and many people go sky fishing and trap puffins in nets. They also hunt for puffin eggs and feathers. Puffins live for about 20 years in the wild. Apart from people, their main predator is the great black-backed gull. Atlantic puffins are not an endangered species but some populations have been severely reduced in number. Puffin colonies are threatened by overfishing, which causes a shortage of food for adults to feed their young. Oil spills are also a danger. Oil not only destroys puffins" waterproofing, it also makes them sick when they clean it off their feathers. Global warming, as well, puts puffins at risk. These birds are adapted to living in water between -20 C and survive by catching fish that live in these cold temperatures. Not only are sea temperatures rising, sea levels are rising, too, and this could flood the puffins" breeding grounds.</p></section>
