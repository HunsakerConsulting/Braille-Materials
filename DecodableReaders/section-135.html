</h2>
<p id="p-176">Hidden deep in the dense jungle that covers the mountains of central Vietnam, lies the biggest cave on the planet. It is so big, its main cavern could fit an entire steret of skyscrapers with 40 floors. The cave was found by chance. Ho, a local boy, was scrambling among the rocks looking for aloe, when he rested against a big rock. He felt a cold breeze and heard the distant rush of an underground river. He went behind the rock. It was pitch black but he felt he was entering a space that was very big. Ho had found the entrance to a vast cave. But the cave was so well hidden that Ho was unable to find it again. Years later, a group of cave experts asked Ho to take them to the cave. But still he could not find it. Ho felt foolish. In 2009, 20 years after he found the cave, Ho set out again, alone, intent on proving that his lost cave existed. This time he found the rock, heard the water and felt the breeze. Yes, he had found the lost cave. Ho had found the biggest cave in the world. The cave is enormous! 100 meters wide, 280 meters high and 4 kilometers long. Its name is Hang Son Doong or Mountain River Cave.</p></section>
