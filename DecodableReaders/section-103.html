<p id="p-117">Ned Makes Amends Tom, Pip and Sam are waiting for Ned when he gets off the train in Bond. A rich man, with hundreds of pounds in his pocket, Ned tells Tom, Pip and Sam his plan. He explains to them that it is time to make amends for their bad deeds and asks them how they can help the men they tried to rob. "Well," say Tom, Pip and Sam as they begin to talk at the same time. "One at a time," says Ned. "Tom can start." "Fred, the jailer, has a sick horse and cannot afford the vet's fees," says Tom. "Mr Bog, at the bank, is old and frail and cannot afford the train ticket to visit his children and grandchildren," says Pip. "The coach, whose occupants we tried to rob, needs a new setof wheels, and the farmer, whose chickens were stolen, needs to be paid back," says Sam. Ned, Pip, Sam and Tom spend the next week carrying out the plan, in secret. The vet finds a ten pound note in his mail box to attend to thejailer's horse. Mr. Bog gets a train ticket in the mail. The coach driver finds a set of wheels resting against his shed and the farmer discovers he has ten extra chickens, when he counts his stock. "That's odd," say the jailer, Mr Bog, the coach driver and the farmer. "That's Ned," say Pip, Sam and Tom together.</p></section>
