<p id="p-251">The Plains Indians made their homes in the part of the country between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. This part is known as the Great Plains. It has grasslands, sterams, valleys, and hills. Some Plains tribes hunted and followed the buffalo as they roamed. Other tribes hunted, raised crops, and lived in villages. Tribes also hunted deer, rabbits, and birds. Tribes picked berries and other plants for food and other uses. Some tribes traded supplies with other tribes. Many Plains tribes lived in tepees. The Plains Indians had many ceremonies. One was named the Sun Dance. It included dancing, singing, and drumming. It lasted for a few days in the summer. The Plains Indians told storiesand legends. These tales were always about times from the past. Children were told stories to help them learn about the past.</p></section>
