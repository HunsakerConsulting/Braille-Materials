<p id="p-332">There was a cabin on Fog Hill. The kids on the bus said it was full of junk. "That is funny," said Flip. The kids said it was not funny. A mad man was living in it. He sang songs with the crickets. Flip went to his mom. She said the kids were messing with him. But he still must not visit the cabin. "It's just an empty cabin," his mom said. "But I went to it as a kid, and got bit by a bug."</p></section>
