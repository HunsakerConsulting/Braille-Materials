</h2>
<p id="p-184">Safari The African bush elephant is the largest living land animal. They can grow as tall as 4 meters. They are very strong and you may be in danger if you do not take care. Elephants are also very intelligent. Their brain is larger than any other land animal. They can feel grief, use tools and remember things. Africa can get very hot and dry. Elephants have some tricks to help them stay cool. They have large flat ears which let a lot of heat out of their body. They can flap the ears like a fan to make a cool breeze. They squirt water on their body like a shower. They roll in the mud and let it dry on their body. The mud keeps them cool and stops them getting sunburnt. It also stops the insects from biting them. Elephants love to swim and they can submerge for a long time. They use their trunk like a snorkel so they can get air. Sometimes they will stay in the river all day. If they are hungry they find weeds to eat. One day when we were out spotting elephants our land rover got a flat tyre right by the elephants. The driver had to get out to change the tyre. He said, "Yell if they come this way." We had to keep guard while the guide changed the tyre. If the elephant got scared he might charge us and kill the driver and tip the land rover over. Look hard at the photograph and you can see the elephant. Elephants use their trunks and tusks to tear at leaves, bark and tere trunks. They eat a huge amount of food every day. Sometimes they just tear out the tere by the roots. They do not leave much for the rest of the animals to eat. Elephants live in a family. A family has about ten females with their calves. The male elephants live in a different family by themselves. When the boy calves are big they go to live with the men. If one mother gets sick or dies this way there are lots of mothers to look after the baby. Elephants are protected. Poachers try to kill them and steal their ivory tusks. The ivory is worth a lot. Both male and female elephants have tusks so poachers kill both. The tusks can grow up to 2 meters long. It was a privilege to go on an African Elephant Safari. I was lucky to have the chance ride an elephant and later to photograph a wild elephant in the bush.</p></section>
