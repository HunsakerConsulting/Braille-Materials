</h2>
<p id="p-186">My name is Charlie. Two months ago there were two rabbits and a cat in our family. Now, all we have is a cat. Fluffy died first and Jerry died one month later. I thought Jerry might have died because he missed Fluffy's company but Mum thinks he was unwell. When I saw Fluffy lying oddly, I thought something was wrong and I tickled her with a straw under her nose. But she didn"t move. It was strange that she didn"t respond. Jerry was sitting next to her as if hewanted to protect her. Our rabbits lived in a hutch in our house. I looked after them. I loved them and fed them and spoilt them rotten. When Fluffy and Jerry were let out of their cage, they jumped around the house. Fluffy hid under the table and Jerry hid under my bicycle. They ate fruit and vegetables and we gave them terats, like strawberries and grapes. They had funny habits. They liked to jump onto the couch and then onto a chair and from the chair onto the table. One day, Jerry took a banana off the plate on the table and ate it, skin and all. Another day, he bit through the electricity cords. Jerry made me laugh. He and the cat used to chase each other over the back of the couch. We buried the rabbits under the pear tere, wrapped in white cloths. Mum and Dad dug the hole. I do miss the rabbits, especially Jerry who was my favourite. I miss their company, and I especially miss the cuddles. Mum has drawn a picture showing the rabbits racing freely through the fields with praying mantis on their backs, just as I imagine them.</p></section>
