</h2>
<p id="p-255">Jenny begged her mom and dad to let her get a puppy. They thought she was bluffing. They told her she had to show she could take responsibility to care for a puppy by washing the dishes for a month. When the month passed, Jenny went with her mom and dad to a shelter. There were a lot of cute puppies. Jenny didn?t know which puppy to pick! She stopped in front of a pen. There sata little black and white puppy. The puppy was a bit shy but let Jenny pet it. Soon, it started licking Jenny's hand. "Hello, little one,"  Jenny said, grinning. Jenny asked if she could hold the puppy. The helper placed the puppy in Jenny's arms. The puppy started to lick Jenny's nose. Jenny giggled and petted the puppy. This was the perfect puppy for her! They were going to be best friends!</p></section>
