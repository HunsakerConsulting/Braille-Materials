</h2>
<p id="p-269">April was in a bright and fragrant field of tulips. She estimated that there were at least fifteen shades of flowers, including violet, red, green, and pink. Then, all of a sudden, April was transported to a gala. She was wearing a dark navy dress and a diamond bracelet. Everyone around her was starting to dance! "How did I get here?"  thought April. As she was thinking, she started to smell bacon. Where was it coming from" It smelled so good, her mouth watered! She thought she heard her grandfather calling her. The alarm on her clock radio went off, and April opened her eyes. It was all just a dream! It was time to wake up and eat breakfast! Before she got out of bed, April took out her diary and documented her crazy dream!</p></section>
