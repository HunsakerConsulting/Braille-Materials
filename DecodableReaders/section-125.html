</h2>
<p id="p-146">There are birds in our roof. I can hear them scratching about, particularly early in the mornings and in the early evening. I think they are starlings. They have been there before, and they are rebuilding their nest. In the mornings they come with thin twigs in their beaks and scuttle along the gutter. One day I got the step ladder and poked my head inside the manhole in the ceiling. I could hear chirping. How do birds get in the roof" Jeff, a gutter-man, came to have a look the other day and said there seemed to be a hole just under the roof line, but he wasn"t sure. So I climbed up a ladder one afternoon and saw two adults land on the gutter with food in their mouths. I watched. The starlings saw me. They didn"t seem to like being looked at. But after a minute, one of them couldn"t wait any longer, and it popped into the roof, exactly where Jeff thought there was a hole. I told Jeff we would need some gutter guard to stop this happening again. But I didn"t want the birds and chicks trapped inside, so I said we would wait till the chicks had left the nest. A few days later there was a terrible commotion. The chicks were learning to fly. It's a long way down and they must have been very scared as they tried out their wings for the first time. Anyway, there was nothing on the ground, like a dead chick, so I guess they all made it OK. A few days later, Jeff came and installed the gutter-guard. But the starlings come back everyday and perch on the mesh. They don"t understand why they can"t get into the roof to rebuild their nest. One bird was so desperate it came down the chimney and I had to let it out through the front door.</p></section>
