<p id="p-314">Dora likes to make things. She thinks of a thing to make and then she puts it together. TodayDora was at the park. She saw a bird open its wings and soar. Seeing this made Dora want wings, too. She went home and drew a pair of wings. Then she got more paper and drew herself soaring. "I will soar today!" said Dora. It was time to make the wings. Dora used feathers for the tops of the wings. She used more feathers on the tips. Dora put on the wings and ran. She flapped her wings until she felt like she was soaring. "I am not a bore!" she yelled. "I can make wings and soar!" Blair's Corn Planter Henry Blair lived over one hundred years ago. He was an inventor, which means that he made new things. One thing he made was a corn planter. Before Blair invented the corn planter, farmers had to put each seed in the ground. Blair thought it would be nice to have a machine do this fast. That is why he made a corn planter. He got a patent in ," :. for the corn planter. The planter planted more than just corn. It also planted other seeds. Once farmers started using the corn planter, they did not have to lean over. Their backs were not sore! Henry Blair was an important inventor. His corn planter has changed over the years. It has helped many farmers. Planters are used more and more every day!</p></section>
