</h2>
<p id="p-298">Thad found a big, thin shell. He got it on the shore. There is a chip in it. "Who lived in this shell?" Thad asks. "I will share this with Jeff." Thad runs to see Jeff. He shows Jeff the shell. "Did it come from a ship?" asks Jeff. "NoI do not think so" says Thad. Unable to tell when the shell came to the shoreThad takes a guess. "It has a chip in it but it is still white. I do not think it is ancient. Did a clam live in it?" Thad asks. "YesI think so" says Jeff. Sheep and Goats Chad likes to go to the farm. He can see a lot of sheep and goats. Dogs chase the sheep on the farm. That is their job. Pat has a job at the farm. "I own nine sheep and five goats. I raise goats. I make cheese from the goat's milk" Pat tells Chad. Chad thinks it's fun to have a job with sheep and goats. "Which job can I do?" asks Chad. Pat tells Chad that he can help shear the sheep's hair. The sheep's hair can be used to make sheets and coats. Chad stays and helps Pat. Rich the Chick Seth will perform in a show. "You will see a chick that can do math!" yells Seth. "It is a play about a chick named Rich!" Seth will be Rich the chick in the play. Rich is an odd chick. He lives by the lake with lots of fish. He likes to play ball and pitch. The chick can also do math. "Math is not bad" Rich the chick likes to say. "I do it each day!" Rich must take a bath and dash up the path. Rich sees a ranch with lots of sad chicks! Rich must help these chicks. He must free the chicks and cut the chain. They will be free in a flash!Jill's Sash Mitch makes clothes for shows. He gets cash to buy cloth. Mitch is in a rush. He has to dash to a show. Jill has lost her red sash! "What a shame" says Mitch. "I ran out of red! I will make Jill a white sash." But Mitch can not remember how to make the sash. "Just my luck!" he moans. "Did I stitch this up or down" I did not take notes!" Mitch must rush the white sash to Jill. "I hope Jill will like it" he says. "I hope it will match." Jill hugs Mitch when he ties on the sash. "This does match!" she cries. "What a day!" sighs Mitch.</p></section>
