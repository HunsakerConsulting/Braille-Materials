</h2>
<p id="p-91">We live on a steep block. It stertches from the top of the hill to the train track at the bottom. It is difficult to cut the grass. So we got a goat. Ajax, the goat, was big. He was as big as Dad when he stood on his back legs. And he was strong and had a habit of kicking or butting you if you went up to him. Mum and I lived in terror. Ajax's job was to nibble the grass. But as well as the grass, he gobbled up the sweet corn and trampled on Mum's tomato crop. When he attacked the cherry teres, Mum went ballistic. "The goat must go," she cried. And he did. Dad put an ad on Gum Tree, "Goat For Free" and got 9 responses. I was not sad to see him go. But we still had the problem of the grass. Next, we tried sheep. Kath and Kim were sweet and, at the beginning, things went well. They just munched on the grass. But when they ran out of grass, they attacked the roses. The prickles did not stop them. Mum wept. Then, one morning, the sheep got to Mum's sweet corn crop. Mum was frantic! "That's it! We have to get rid of the sheep." But Dad and I resisted. We are fond of the sheep. In the end, we agreed to keep Kim and sell Kath, and Dad erected a fence to protect the plants and food crops. At the moment, all is well. We have 2 dogs, 1 sheep, 18 chooks  and hundreds of bees.</p></section>
