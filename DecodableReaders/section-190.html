Ruth felt lucky because she had learned to speak Chinese. When Ruth's family got to China, she went to a new school. She missed her pals. She did not know anyone, but soon she made a best friend, Phen. Phen and Ruth were in the same class. Phen and Ruth rushed to shops and even had a photograph made. They rode bikes and played fun games. When it came time to go back home, Ruth and Phen hugged. When Ruth got back home, she was gladto see her friends but missed Phen, so Phen and Ruth became pen pals.</p></section>
