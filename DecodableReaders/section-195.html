</h2>
<p id="p-243">Clare wanted a pet. She did not want a pet with hair because it could shed. She begged her dad to take her to the pet fair. Her dad put the car in gear and they drove to the fair. When they got there, her dad said,  "Clare, let's look at the snakes!"  She hada fear of snakes, but she gritted her teeth and went near. Clare looked in the tank and could hear the snake slither. The man at the fair let Clare hold the snake. She thought it would be slick, but it was dry. The snake flicked its tongue and Clare giggled.  "Dad, can I have a snake?"  Clare asked. "Will you take care of it?"  Dad asked. "I will!"  said Clare. Dad grinned and said yes! Clare named her snake Deary.</p></section>
