<p id="p-304">Sue was chewing the stew that her mom made. There was a big boom in the back room! "Oh my!" said Sue. "The window blew shut. There must be a lot of wind!" Sue went to the back room and peered outside. The sky was blue. Sue went back to eat the rest of her stew and drink her fruit juice. After she finished eating, she went to the back room again. She peered outside. The sky was gray. "Will it rain?" Sue thought. "I had better close the windows. If there is a storm, it will not destroy my home!" Sue closed the windows just in time. The rain started to fall hard when she closed the last one! Stew's BruiseStew has a new blue bruise on his arm. How did he get it" Stew's new car got stuck in the mud after a flood. He did his best to move the car. His arm got stuck in the car's window. It just would not move! Then Stew's new car ran out of fuel. "I will have to push it!" exclaimed Stew. "The mud is preventing it from moving." Stew got out of his car. He waded in the water. "Oh, no!" said Stew. "Why did it have to flood today?" Stew pushed and pushed until his car was home. "My arm hurts from pushing" he said. Stew spotted a blue mark on his arm. "I got a bruise" he sighed. "I do not want to push my car again. That was no fun at all!"</p></section>
