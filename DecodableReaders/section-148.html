<p id="p-189">Dung beetles eat dung. What is dung" Dung is poo! There are dung beetles that live everywhere except Antarctica. This might sound like a very bad job to have but it is very important. It recycles waste, stops sickness from germs from the poo and takes seeds to different places. There are many different types of dung beetles. Most of them are black and shiny. They are very strong and can roll a ball of dung which is 25 times as heavy as they are. Dung beetles are insects and have six legs and wings. Some dung beetles ride on the animals they eat the dung from. When the animal drops some dung the beetles hop off and collect the dung. Other dung beetles have a very strong sense of smell and just sniff out the dung they like. They roll some of the dung into a ball and start to roll it back to their tunnel to store it to eat later. Most dung beetles like the dung of herbivores "animals which eat plants, so there are lots of seeds in the dung. Sometimes they turn round and use their back legs to roll the ball if it gets stuck on something. They go in a line to the place they need to get to. If a big rock or hill is in the way they just go over it. One very big dung beetle can roll more than one thousand times its own weight. That is like a man tugging 12 buses full of people. This dung beetle is digging a hole to put his dung ball in. They have to be very quick to get the ball of dung hidden because some lazy dung beetles try to rob dung balls so they do not have to make their own. As well as using dung balls for food, they also lay their eggs in a dung ball. When dung beetles mate they roll a dung ball to the place they are going to hide it. They lay the eggs inside it. That way the baby dung beetles have lots of food when they hatch.</p></section>
