<p id="p-237">I went to help my nephew, Joseph, with his school math contest. He was a new kid at his school. Joseph had overheard that the prize was a trophy. First, we had to think of what math problem we wanted to solve. Then we gathered materials to show on a display board. The board explained how and why Joseph got the results of the math problem. We took a photograph of Joseph with the display board. Joseph was shy when he presented his project. He wished he did not have to stand and talk in front of his class. He spoke in a low whisper and blushed when the class clapped. When hefinished, his teacher thanked him. Then he went back to his seat. Joseph felt glad and proud!</p></section>
