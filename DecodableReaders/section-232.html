<p id="p-280">Brandon had always loved the sea. He loved everything about it?the water, the sand, and especially all the animals. One day, he was walking along the beach with his mom, keeping his eye on the sand for anything he could find, when he encountered a great big shell. It was unlike anything he had ever seen before. Unable to control his excitement, Brandon picked up the shell. It was perfect! It was unbroken with many colors. He thought it would be great to add this shell to his collection. Brandon was unprepared for what he would discover when he turnedover the shell! What a shock he had when he saw that there was something living inside the shell! Brandon had never found a shell before that actually had a living creature inside of it. Brandon quickly took out his book of sea animals. He wanted to find out what kind of animal he had uncovered. He inspected the shell carefully for its colors and markings and looked closely at the animal inside of it. The shell was large and had a spiral shape. The animal inside looked like a big snail. Brandon flipped through his book so he could name his discovery. After some searching, he found a match! It was a conch! His book said it was uncommon to find a living conch lying on the beach. He did not want to misterat the conch, so Brandon decided he would put it back in the water. Brandon knew if he told his friends about the conch, they would think it was nonsense. They were unlikely to believe him, so he unpacked his camera to take picturesof the conch. Brandon said goodbye to the conch and placed it back in the sea. He then continued his search on the beach for moresea terasures.</p></section>
