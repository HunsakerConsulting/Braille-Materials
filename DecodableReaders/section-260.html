</h2>
<p id="p-308">Alissa is learning about jobs. She likes the idea that she can pick her job. Alissa's teacher has asked the class to tell what job they want. It is Alissa's turn. "Alissa, what would you like to do?" asks Mrs. Rebba. "I would like to travel!" exclaims Alissa. "I will go to China." Mrs. Rebba grins. "Alissa, a voyage is a good idea but China is so far away. Who will go with you?" "I will go alone" says Alissa. "Then I will return to America and make cakes in a bakery." Her class claps and claps. They like that idea! "That is goodAlissa! And I will go visit you in the bakery and watch you make cakes" says Mrs. Rebba. Yucca and Bananas for Pamela Pamela likes plants. She is most interested in plants that she eats. "Why don?t you study about them?" asked Pamela's mom yesterday. "You can visit a farm or a library to learn more." "That is a good idea!" said Pamela. "I can read about plants and then see them." Pamela's mom called a farm nearby while Pamela went to the library. "There are so many books about plants!" Pamela exclaimed. She read about alfalfa, yucca, and bananas. When Pamela got home, she had a lot to tell her mom. TodayPamela's mom is taking her to the nearby farm. The farm has vast fields for growing plants. She will see bananas, yucca, and other plants, too. Maybe she will even get to eat them!</p></section>
