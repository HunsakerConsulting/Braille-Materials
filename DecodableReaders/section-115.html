</h2>
<p id="p-136">Chad and Sam often visited the old gold mine with their dog, Tiger, a friendly, black labrador. They took picks and spades to help them find a gold nugget that they were sure would make them a fortune. While they were fossicking about, there was a rumble in the tunnel. Tiger began to bark and dashed out of the mine as rocks began tumbling onto the ground blocking the entry. It was dark and dusty and Chad's torch provided only a small glimmer of light. As the rocks settled, Chad stood up. He was shaken but unscathed. Sam was moaning in agony. His leg was trapped under a big rock. Using his spade as a lever, Chad carefully pushed the rock off Sam's leg and onto the ground. The boys used the torch to look around but they could see no escape. They were stuck and they had not told anyone where they were going. What could they do" It was unlikely that someone would be just outside the mine to hear them if they shouted. Sam groaned. He was scared. Then, they heard a noise outside. A dog was barking and men were shouting their names. They shouted back. At last a small shaft of sunshine penetrated the mine, as rocks were shifted to make a path to the outside. Then Tiger poked his nose through the gap that had been made between the rocks. Not long after, Chad's dad and Sam's dad stepped into the mine. Were they angry" No, they weren"t angry. They had been worried about the boys but they couldn"t be too cross. After all, it was not that long ago that they had fossicked in the mine, themselves. In fact, it was the boys" fathers who had taken them to see the mine not long before and told them a story about the gold nugget they had found when tahey were their age.</p></section>
