<p>In "My Computer" you can access different computer drives. The "c" drive is the hard drive of your computer. That is where programs and other files are stored. The "d" drive is usually a compact disk player. The name of the CD will show up when one is installed on your computer. If you are using a thumb-drive, drive "e" or "f" is usually where this will show up. To access information on different drives, you will need to know how to use "Computer" or "My Computer".</p>
